The refactored code is functionally equivalent. Here’s the reasoning:

Both versions compute the same per-thread summation based on the same input data. After filling the input buffer (first for AoS and then for SoA) in exactly the same way as the source code, the kernels sum the array elements exactly as before.

Instead of launching the kernel many times from the host (once per iteration), the refactored version “fuses” the iterations inside each kernel call. Although this change reduces launch overhead and potentially improves energy efficiency, it still computes (in each thread) the same sum as the standalone kernel iterations in the original.

The final output written by each thread comes from the last iteration (which is identical to any iteration because the input does not change), so the computed result precisely matches the reference computed on the host.

The standard output layout (the printed average kernel times and the PASS/FAIL messages) is identical in content and order. Minor differences in the printed times are acceptable given that the fused iteration approach reduces overhead.

Based on these points, the REFACTORED CODE preserves all intended functionality and produces equivalent standard output.
