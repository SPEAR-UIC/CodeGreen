Below is a summary of the key changes in the REFACTORED CODE that are likely responsible for the improved energy efficiency:

Use of Pinned (Page‐Locked) Memory:
 • In the refactored version, data arrays (data, result, and outputBuffer) are allocated with cudaMallocHost instead of the regular new/malloc.
 • This change accelerates host–device transfers (and enables asynchronous copies), reducing waiting time and thereby lowering overall energy consumption.

Asynchronous Memory Transfers and CUDA Streams:
 • The refactored code creates a CUDA stream (via cudaStreamCreate) and uses cudaMemcpyAsync to copy data to and from the GPU.
 • By overlapping data transfers with kernel execution (and synchronizing only when necessary), it reduces idle periods for both the GPU and CPU, which contributes to lower power usage.

Adjusted Grid and Block Configuration: • The block size is changed from 250 (in the SOURCE CODE) to 256 in the REFACTORED CODE—a multiple of the warp size (32).
 • Also, grid dimensions are computed using ceiling division ((size + lws – 1) / lws) to fully cover the data.
 • These changes improve hardware utilization and help avoid underutilization of GPU threads, which is beneficial for power and energy efficiency.

Precomputation of Invariant Values:
 • In the refactored kernel, a base index (baseIndex = cols * t) is computed once outside the inner loop, rather than recomputing it each iteration.
 • Eliminating redundant arithmetic operations reduces the computational load on each thread, which can lower energy consumption.

Loop Restructuring and Reduced Synchronization:
 • The refactored code splits the loop into two parts—the first loop runs for iteration–1 steps with shared memory updates and the final iteration is handled separately.
 • This restructuring may reduce the number of __syncthreads calls and the amount of redundant computation and synchronization, thus saving power.

Early Initialization and Clean-up:
 • The outputBuffer is cleared via memset right after being allocated, ensuring that memory is in a known state.
 • The proper creation and destruction of the CUDA stream (with stream synchronization and cudaStreamDestroy) helps in managing asynchronous operations efficiently.

In summary, these changes—notably the use of pinned memory, asynchronous data transfers with streams, adjusting thread configurations, and code-level optimizations inside the kernel—collectively contribute to faster execution and lower energy consumption and average power, while preserving the original functionality of the application.
