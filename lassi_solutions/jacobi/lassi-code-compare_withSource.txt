Below is a summary of the key changes made in the refactored code that suggest energy‐efficiency improvements compared to the original source:

Use of Page‐Locked (Pinned) Host Memory:
 • In the refactored code, host memory for arrays f and f_old is allocated using cudaHostAlloc rather than aligned_alloc. Pinned memory reduces data transfer overhead between host and device and can lower energy consumption by improving transfer efficiency.

Asynchronous Memory Operations:
 • Instead of blocking calls, the refactored version uses cudaMemsetAsync to reset the error and cudaMemcpyAsync (with a dedicated CUDA stream) to copy the error value from device to host. Overlapping memory transfers with computations helps reduce idle periods on the GPU and CPU, thereby reducing overall power draw.

Pointer Swapping Instead of Kernel Launch for Data Swap:
 • The refactored code eliminates the separate swap kernel. Instead, it swaps the device pointers on the host (using std::swap). Reducing a kernel launch saves energy by lowering the launch overhead and reducing unnecessary GPU activity.

Cache Configuration Optimization:
 • The refactored code calls cudaDeviceSetCacheConfig(cudaFuncCachePreferL1). This hints to the GPU to favor L1 over shared memory use, which may lead to more energy‐efficient caching behaviors depending on the hardware.

Optimized Reduction Strategy:
 • While both versions perform a block-level reduction for error computation, the refactored code uses a larger shared memory array (s_err) along with an initial shared‐memory reduction followed by warp-level reductions. The refactored approach minimizes synchronization overhead, which can also help reduce power consumption by shortening active compute periods.

Code Organization and Minor Adjustments:
 • The refactored version makes slight improvements in variable naming (for instance, using i and j clearly and relying on blockDim.x instead of hard-coded numbers) and adds comments indicating energy-aware design intentions.
 • It includes additional headers (such as <cooperative_groups.h>) to potentially leverage advanced synchronization (even though it is not extensively used) which signals an awareness of energy/performance efficient collective operations.

Overall, these changes contribute to lowering both the total energy consumption (from 1292.89 J down to 698.09 J) and the average power (from 163.65 W down to 105.93 W) during execution without changing the algorithmic functionality.
